Game Rules:

"Bulls and Cows" is a number guessing game where the player's objective is to guess a secret number chosen by the opponent. The player makes a guess, and the opponent provides two types of feedback: the number of correct digits in the correct position (referred to as "bulls") and the number of correct digits in the wrong position (referred to as "cows"). Based on this feedback, the player iteratively refines their guess until the secret number is successfully determined.
